# What is yomama website

Yo mama will organize yo mama jokes into categories.

Categories are arrays of objects.

The main file would look like this:

```json
{
  "fat": [
    {
      "joke": "Yo mama so fat, not even Ninja could carry her in Fortnite!",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8jWF6P-8jY?start=19"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or it could be split into more than one file.
